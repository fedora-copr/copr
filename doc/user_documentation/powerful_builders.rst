Builders in Fedora Copr are too slow!
=====================================

The *normal* Fedora Copr builders are typically fast enough for the vast majority
of package builds.  However, some package builds are extremely
resource-intensive, and our *normal builders* struggle with them.  A notable
example is Blink_-based browsers, which can take even more than 24 hours to
build.

From a build system perspective, this isn't a problem.  You can simply specify
``--timeout 180000`` (in seconds) and be prepared to wait for the build to
finish.  But if you want to expedite your builds, you do have the option to
request *high-performance builders*.

Pros & Cons of *high-performance builders*
------------------------------------------

Once you get them, the *high-performance builders* will handle your builds much
faster.  According to the specification as of October 2023, they are
approximately 8 times faster than the *normal builders*, but the actual speedup
is very task-dependent.

The downside is that they are in limited supply. If other users request them at
the same time as you, you'll compete with others, and you may spend a bit longer
waiting in the queue until one such machine is allocated for you (*starting*
phase of the build).

Also, because these machines are costly, we never pre-allocate them (as we do
with the normal builders to generally minimize the initial waiting).  We only
start these *high-performance* ones when a specific build request them.  Waiting
for the corresponding machine to start may take several additional minutes.

It's worth noting that when you configure your project, chroot, or package to
use *high-performance builders*, you will get them, sooner or later.  There's no
magical "fallback to normal builders".  **The rule of thumb** is to avoid using
*high-performance builders* for builds that are expected to complete in less than
two hours on *normal builders*.

How to request *high-performance builders*
------------------------------------------

As of October 2023, we only support *high-performance builders* for ``x86``,
``aarch64`` and ``s390x``.  Please think carefully (ensure you understand the
previous section) and submit an issue_.  The pattern we have to configure for you
is basically a Python regexp in a format ``owner/project/chroot/package``, e.g.
``@asahi/kernel/.(x86_64|aarch64)/kernel.*``.
