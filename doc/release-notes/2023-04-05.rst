Highlights from 2023-04-05 release
==================================

Updated client packages are shipped in `Fedora 36`_,  `Fedora 37`_,  `Fedora 38`_
`EPEL 7`_, `EPEL 8`_, and `EPEL 9`_ Bodhi updates.


Disable AppStream for existing Copr projects
--------------------------------------------

We decided to disable AppStream metadata generation for all project
excluding those mentioned in `Fedora discussion`_ due to very high I/O
demand of ``appstream-builder`` tool which causes failures in builds
even for medium-sized projects. If you want to enable generating AppStream
data for your project (with a relatively high chance of a random build
failure due to a timeout), please go to project settings and enable it back.
(`#2577`_)


Fixing slow searching in Fedora Copr projects
---------------------------------------------

Searching in Copr was slow and often timeout. We discussed options
to switch to another search engine since our current search engine
``whoosh`` seemed to be slow. We managed to speed up the search
speed. (`#2534`_)


``createrepo`` can be run without ``--database``
------------------------------------------------

Previously, we wan ``createrepo`` with ``--database`` option, which
we do not need (see discussion in `#1171`_). Now we decided to don't
create SQLite databases and run ``createrepo`` with ``--no-database``
option to save some space. (`#2570`_)



Notable changes
---------------

- Previously, when you uploaded src.rpm to be built in non-enabled chroot,
  Copr emitted an error after the upload of src.rpm. Now we check the
  chroot before you upload the src.rpm. (`#2524`_)
- We introduced a new cli command ``copr get`` which returns detailed
  information about desired project. (`#2582`_)
- ``copr download-build`` command is getting new ``--review`` option which
  downloads only fedora-review files (`#2584`_)
- ``copr create`` has new option ``--follow-fedora-branching`` with which you
  can turn ``follow-fedora-branching`` on or off in your project. (`#2545`_)
