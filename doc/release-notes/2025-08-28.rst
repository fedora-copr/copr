Highlights from 2025-08-28 release
==================================

Pulp
----

In a collaboration with the Pulp team, we invest a lot of development time into
`supporting Pulp as a storage for Copr results`_. The goal is to ultimately
reduce the maintenance burden on us.

This release implements support for several features, such as project forking and
projects with manual createrepo. It brings bugfixes for building into CoprDirs,
and build deletion, and smaller improvements in labeling the results. But
most importantly, it brings huge performance improvements for the fundamental
operations like creating new Copr projects and uploading build results.


Enhancements
------------

- New AlmaLinux and CentOS logos
- Redirect to the previous page after OIDC login
- `#3511`_ - After editing a package, we redirect to the package details
- `#3192`_ - Show CoprDirs names in the builds table
- `#3622`_ - When creating a new project through the "+ Fedora Review" button,
  networking is disabled for its builds
- `#3721`_ - When a project has too many CoprDirs, we now show only the first 50
  and hide the rest under a `details` tag
- Huge ``copr_log_hitcounter`` script optimizations to reduce memory usage
- Modernized ``python-copr-common``, ``python-copr``, ``copr-backend``,
  ``copr-cli``, and ``copr-messaging`` specfiles to not use ``%py3_build`` and
  ``%py3_install`` macros anymore.


Bugfixes
--------

- `#3769`_ - Dropped support for OID login. Don't confuse with OIDC, which is
  still available and the preferred method of authentication
- `#3077`_ - Fixed broken encoding in logs
- `#3707`_, `#3760`_ - Don't show AI buttons for running builds and deleted
  builds
- `#3826`_, `#2124`_ - Fixed a bug in communication between ``copr-backend`` and
  builders that caused dying workers and missing logs
- `#3683`_ - Fixed ``pagure-events`` traceback for Copr names containing a dot
- `#3666`_ - Fixed ``pagure-events`` traceback for incorrect project names
- `#3682`_ - Not using a deprecated ``get_html_theme_path`` function for our
  documentation
- `#3743`_ - Fixed generation of storage consumption charts
- `#3662`_ - Fixed FTBFS for F43 because of ``copy.deepcopy``
- `#3770`_, `#3777`_ - Fixed a race condition when running createrepo, causing
  leftovers in our redis database and errors when deleting builds
- Many fixes for `our docker-compose development environment`_
