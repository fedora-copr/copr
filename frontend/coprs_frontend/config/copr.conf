# /api_v3/gssapi_login/ route.
# When KRB5_LOGIN is enabled together with FAS_LOGIN, users are forced to first
# log-in into Copr build system via OpenID -- so we get their info about FAS
# groups and the real e-mail (nb the fedoraproject.org alias is only created for

#                   from the realm have the same email domain.  E.g. users we
#                   configure that all users in Fedora FAS have the
