# import-error
#     This is to fix our Jenkins CI where we do not have all the build
#     requirements for all our sub-components.  We can afford not listening to
#     this error because our packaging CI would discover the problems anyways.
# too-few-public-methods
#     It's often useful to inherit from some (even library) class, and override
#     some static property or even just constructor.  This though makes PyLint
#     warn us if parent method doesn't provide the minimal amount of methods,
#     reported here: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/4352
#     It's inconvenient to silence this per-class.
# consider-using-f-string
#     "style" warnings, usage of the f-strings is not yet approved by our team
# cyclic-import
#     Seems like cyclic-import is just a style check which is not going to be
