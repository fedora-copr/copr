        Calculate the "dynamic" task priority, based on the actual queue size
        and queue structure.  We have this matrix of counters:

            _counter["background"]["user"]["arch"]["sandbox"] = value

        Each dimension "re-sets" the priority and starts counting from zero.
        Simply, the later the task is submitted (higher build ID) the less
        priority it gets (== gets higher priority number).

        We want to have separate counters for:

        - normal and background builds (background jobs are always penalized by
          the BuildQueueTask.frontend_priority), those are two separate but
          equivalent queues here

        - for each architecture (includes the source builds), that's because
          each architecture needs to have it's own "queue"/pool of builders
          (doesn't make sense to penalize e.g. ppc64le tasks and delay them
          because of a heavy x86_64 queue)

        - For each sandbox.  Each sandbox is equivalent to each other.  This
          means that builds submitted to 'jdoe/foo--user1' should be taken with
          the same priority as 'jdoe/baz-user1' (note the same owner pattern!)
          no matter *when* they are submitted.  This is useful when 'jdoe/foo'
          get's huge batch of builds, and _then_ after some time some _other_
          builds are submitted into the 'jdoe/baz'; those 'jdoe/baz builds could
          be blocked for a very long time.  See below.

        Note that for large queues, build_dispatcher isn't sometimes able to
        handle all the tasks in the priority queue in one cycle (we are able to
        process several hundreds, or at most thousands of tasks — depending on
        the 'sleeptime' value).  Therefore, the priority really matters here, as
        we want to avoid all kinds of the weird builder/queue starving
        situations.  In other words — if task isn't processed in one
        WorkerManager.run(timeout=???) cycle — it may stay "pending" for many
        other cycles too (depending on how quickly the overall queue get's
        processed).
