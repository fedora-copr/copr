"""
Print a set of 'resalloc ticket-close' commands to be manually executed if there
are some tickets that deserve a manual close (because backend knows nothing
about them).

This script is using a heuristic by analyzing the `ps aux` output because we
don't track the list of tickets anywhere (only the corresponding builder knows
it's own ticket ID).  It would be risky to expect that the lists of IDs are
complete (no lock between the used_ids() and all_ids() calls).  Therefore we
take the oldest used ticket (copr can not take any older one in the future), and
then we don't suggest removing of any newer ticket ID than that one.
