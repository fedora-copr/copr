# Set a number of build groups (default is 1)

# For each build group set:
#   name - name of the group (will be shown in the worker process name)
#   archs - architectures to build by this group
#   spawn_playbook - path to an ansible playbook which spawns a builder
#   terminate_playbook - path to an ansible playbook to terminate the builder
#   max_workers - maximum number of workers in this group
#   max_vm_total - maximum number of VM which can run in parallel
#   max_vm_per_user - maximum number of VM which can use one user in parallel
#   max_builds_per_vm - maximum consequetive builds on one VM
#   max_spawn_processes=2 - max number of spawning playbooks run in parallel
#   vm_spawn_min_interval=30 - after you spin up one VM wait this number of seconds
#   vm_dirty_terminating_timeout=12 - if user do not reuse VM within this number second then VM is terminated
#   vm_health_check_period=120 - every X seconds try to check if VM is still alive
#   vm_health_check_max_time=300 - after this number seconds is not alive it is marked as failed
#   vm_max_check_fails=2 - when machine is consequently X times marked as failed then it is terminated
#   vm_terminating_timeout=600 - when machine was terminated and terminate PB did not finish within this number of second, we will run the PB once again.
#
#   Use prefix groupX where X is number of group starting from zero.
#   Warning: any arch should be used once, so no two groups to build the same arch
