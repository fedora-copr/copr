This file contains some "should" rules, that are good to follow.

- coprs.logic
-- The methods of *Logic objects should generally be @classmethod.
-- The methods of *Logic objects should accept "user" as a second argument
   (after the "cls" argument). This argument should contain object of user
   who is performing the action.
-- The methods of *Logic objects shouldn't call db.session.commit(). This
   should be called in views that use the methods.
-- The usual names of methods are (each of the methods can perform certain
   checks, e.g. authorization, correct parameters, ...):
--- "add" for creating objects and adding them to session
--- "new" for just adding objects to session
--- "get" for getting a query object for a single model object
--- "get_multiple" for getting a query object for multiple model objects
--- "edit" for editing objects and adding them to session
--- "update" for just adding altered objects to session
--- "delete" for deleting an object
